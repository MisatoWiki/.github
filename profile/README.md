# 🙋‍♀️ | _A short introduction_

I'm the founder of this project: <a href="https://github.com/RqndomHax">RqndomHax</a>.
When watching an anime, or a movie and I wanted to have more informations on a characters I was always going on a wiki site.
But sadly nowadays, the existing wiki sites are style "old-designed", I don't really like being here.
And on top of that, there are ads, of course there are tools like adblock to remove ads, but just why,
This project will be financed with my own money as I want everyone to be able to use the site without having to pay.

If you want to support this project you can sponsor it, or just collaborate as a developer.
